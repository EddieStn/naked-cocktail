            <p>George and Simon have been best friends since 2009, having met at University. We have a passion for cocktails and
            mixology. Naked Cocktails was born in 2017 with the simple aim to deliver Cocktail Lessons that provide mouth-watering
            cocktails whilst each and every person at the party has lots of fun and laughter. Fast forward to 2021 and Naked
            Cocktails have provided over 250 Cocktail Masterclasses. We love nothing more than to see everybody enjoying themselves
            and look forward to hearing from you!</p>
